## What is Health App?
Health App is a combined Body Mass Index(BMI) calculator and Calories Burn Calculator mobile application according to MIT App Inventor which is to measure the person's weight and height, and measure the calories burned by the user. Also, it can record the BMI or calories burn every time users calculate their latest BMI and calories burn. The app can display the charts for the users to show the recorded BMI or calories burn.

## Development Tool
This project is developed using [MIT App Inventor 2](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/).

## Usage
Through this Health App, users need to install an application named <b>MIT AI2 Companion</b> inside their mobile phone in order to connect with the [MIT App Inventor 2](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) from the browser. After connecting both of them, user will be directed to the Health App with 3 functions provided which are <b><i>BMI Calculator</i></b>, <b><i>Calorie Calculator</i></b>, and <b><i>Show History</i></b>.

<li><b>BMI Calculator</b></li>
In this BMI Calculator tab, users will need to key in their name, weight(in kg) and height(in cm) to calculate their BMI. After keying in 3 of the fields, users have to press "<i>Calculate!</i>" button in order to calculate the BMI result. The screen will show the result of BMI and whether the user is Underweight, Healthy(Normal), Overweight, or Obese.

After keying in 3 of the fields, users have to press "<i>Calculate</i>" button in order to calculate the Calorie Burn result. The screen will show the result of calories burn and whether they're Low calories burned, Normal calories burned, or High calories burned. After getting the result, the screen will show user a button "<i>Store Data</i>" for users to save the calculated result into the database.
<br />
<br />
<li><b>Show History</b></li>
