## What is Health App?
Health App is a combined Body Mass Index(BMI) calculator and Calories Burn Calculator mobile application according to MIT App Inventor which is to measure the person's weight and height, and measure the calories burned by the user. Also, it can record the BMI every time users calculate their latest BMI. The app can display the charts for the users to show the recorded BMI of users.

## Development Tool
This project is developed using [MIT App Inventor 2](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/).

## Usage
Through this Health App, users need to install an application named <b>MIT AI2 Companion</b> inside their mobile phone in order to connect with the [MIT App Inventor 2](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) from the browser. After connecting both of them, user will be directed to the Health App with 3 functions provided which are <b><i>BMI Calculator</i></b>, <b><i>Calorie Calculator</i></b>, and <b><i>Show History</i></b>.

<li><b>BMI Calculator</b></li>
In this BMI Calculator function, users will need to key in their name, weight(in kg) and height(in cm) to calculate their BMI. After keying in 3 of the fields, users have to press "<i>Calculate!</i>" button in order to calculate the BMI result. The screen will show the result of BMI and whether the user is Underweight, Healthy(Normal), Overweight, or Obese. After getting the result, the screen will show user a function "<i>Save name and BMI to database</i>" button for users to save the calculated result into the database.<br />
